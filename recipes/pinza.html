  <h2 class="headers">Description</h2>
  <p>Pinza (or pinsa, if you wanna spell it like a local), it's a dessert that essentially bids 
    farewell to Winter's Festivities. But don't be sad yourself: indulge in a slice of this 
    Venetian polenta flour cake filled with dried fruit and flavoured with grappa, fennel and orange
    zest and you'll see that it takes more than the 6th of January to take away the holiday vibes!
  </p>
  <p>Once again, don't be fooled by the appearances: a cake rustic in nature, pinsa it's fairly 
    easy to prepare. Just get ready to mash some dry fruit and dough together ;)
