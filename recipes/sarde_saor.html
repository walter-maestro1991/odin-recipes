    <h2 class="headers">Description</h2>
    <p>A great example of a poor dish that, over time, has become a symbol of traditional cuisine of the Veneto region. 
        Apparently dating back to the 14th century, Sarde in Saor can now be found in any traditional “bacaro”, 
        the Venetian “osteria” where humble typical dishes and the unmissable spritz are served.</p>
    <p>It can be prepared either for special occasions, 
        such as the Redentore Festival in July, or for convivial meals with family and friends: 
        any moment will do!</p>
